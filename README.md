### Hi! :wave: My name is Ricardo Grade. I'm 22. :boom:

- :mortar_board: I'm a Bologna MSc Student in Computer Science & Engineering @ Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. In which I've specialized in Distributed Systems & Cyber-Security.
- :pencil: I'm working on my master's dissertation on an app designed to support location-certified smart tourism. The goal is to integrate a peer-based location certification strategy into the app, which leverages the moments when user devices see each other, while empowering the app to deliver an engaging tourist experience to the user, resorting to gamification and user experience elements.
- :zap: I'm ambitious. I'm guided by goals. I'm always improving myself. Thanks to my creativity I can always find a simpler way to solve the problems to which I'm challenged.
- :star: I love to program. I love to be challenged. I like to solve difficult problems, think of solutions that no one thought of or discover better's.
